This page is intended to tell you what I've done, and what i'm good at. So that you can decide where I can be useful to you:
1. Investment & Wealth Management (Family Office Stuff)
2. Technical Trading Setups & Systems (I happen to have a CMT Designation as well)
3. Consulting for Investment Strategies
4. Telling you I told you so both before and after you make a stupid investment
5. Give you good recommendations for the best whiskeys and golf kits... because the rest is taken care of


All the cockiness you see here on this site is because I can't afford to be cocky in Investment Management, so I take it all out here.
