## Hi

I'm a guy who called it quits before the last hurdle of Chartered Accountancy to change my career's direction and get into finance and investment management. I just thought "better late than never".

After working in a hardcore Auditing firm, I moved over to the Startup world where I was involved in valuations, analysis and creating excel models so complicated that it made marriage seem sweet.

After a short stint there, I decided to take advantage of the supportive equity markets and decided to freelance as an Investment Advisor to a few known people.

Fast forward a year and three quarters, I was taking care of Investments : Analysis, Management & Advisory in a Multi-Family office in Bangalore, IN.

After heading enough for lack of enough sleep, I took a move out, for a good 4 months of detox before I started Trading for a global Prop Trading firm.

Through these years, many things have changed, but, me, coming to work like everyday was a casual friday, enough cola to flood pompei again in one hand, and earphones on the other hasn't changed. That's pretty much the guy that I am.

If you think you're good at analysing people through seeing what they listen to on a daily basis, my music tastes are on this page as well.
If I wasn't sitting in front of the terminal, I'd rather be playing badminton for 15 minutes and get back to looking at the terminal screen again.
