Music is the language of the Soul, and I believe one can judge anyone based on the music they listen to.

Here are 5 artists I listen to on a daily basis (has been the same for at least 4 yrs. I don't change my playlists)

1. AC/DC
2. John Denver
3. Steely Dan
4. Lynyrd Skynrd
5. Don Mclean


On the Genre side, this is my Top 5 (And, I tend to hate Pop after '90, metal, and post '00 hip hop)
1. Rock that is as hard as a diamond
2. Blues
3. Country
4. Jazz
5. Classical

Talking about classical: Bach, Paganini, Vivaldi & Tchaikovsky are my go tos.
